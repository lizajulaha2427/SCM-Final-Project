            Personal financial management refers to "ways" or "methods" of managing ones own personal finances. It is also known by its acronym, PFM, which refers to the type of software used for personal finance apps. Simply put, PFM refers to software that helps users manage their money. PFM often lets users categorize transactions and add accounts from multiple institutions into a single view. PFM also typically includes data visualizations such as spending trends, budgets and net worth.

History
PFM started in 1983 with the founding of Intuit. Scott Cook and Tom Proulx, the companyâ€™s founders, witnessed the rise of the personal computer and saw an opportunity to develop personal financial software.[1] Their flagship product, Quicken, became a standard for many households and was eventually followed by QuickBooks, which helped small businesses manage their finances.[2]

Around the same time, a similar competing product introduced by MECA Software, conceived by MECA President Gerald Rubin, and designed by author Andrew Tobias called Managing-Your-Money (MYM) came out,[3] first running on the Apple-II, and later the IBM-PC.[4] Later in 1990 Microsoft released their own PFM platform called Microsoft Money.

Microsoft worked with Intuit and CheckFree in 1997 to create Open Financial Exchange (OFX), which allowed financial institutions to exchange data with web users, paving the way for online PFM software.[5] Yodlee was founded in 1999. Originally a site that let users view email, banking, news, travel, and shopping in one place,[6] it soon pivoted to focus exclusively on banking, allowing users to view their financial accounts from different institutions all at once.
